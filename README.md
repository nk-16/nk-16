### Hi there üëã

## About Me

I am Naman Khetan

üîß Mechanical Engineer | üí° Problem Solver | üöÄ Innovator

I am a senior undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student pursuing a BTech in IIT BHU. I hailed from Raebareli, Uttar Pradesh. My research interests lie in soft robotics, smart materials, mechatronics, design optimization, and legged robotics. 

## My journey

I am quite passionate about core mechanical engineering. In my first year, my interests were inclined towards design, manufacturing, and materials, which I have been introduced to in my coursework. Exploring new materials and rapid manufacturing methods in my sophomore year, I learned about smart materials and 3D printing. Searching for the application of these things, I got to know about soft robotics. I was overwhelmed since robotics has always been a fascinating subject for me. I ideated a soft robotic fish for an IIT Madras BioTech competition, earning a top-10 spot nationwide and boosting my confidence. Expanding on this success, I joined the Robotics Research Group (RoboReG) at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, where weekly paper reading sessions set the stage for my subsequent research internship at IISc Bengaluru.

During my internship at Stoch Lab, RBCCPS, IISc, under Prof. Shishir N.Y. Kolathaya's guidance, I gained hands-on experience in design optimisation. My work was part of quadruped robot research for autonomous transportation in complex terrains in collaboration with the Indian Army. My role includes CAD modelling of a mammal-type quadruped-legged robot with articulated legs. The research internship at IISc was pivotal, revealing my journey from a foundation in core mechanical engineering to practical implementation in robotics design. It solidified my desire to delve deeper into and contribute to this field. 

Getting a broad overview of the research in the robotics field in IISc, I felt the need to do something in a soft robotics-centred lab, which I got to do in the Robotics Materials Department of Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Stuttgart, under Prof. Christopher Keplinger during my DAAD WISE internship. I worked on fabricating soft electrohydraulic actuators for legged robotics and ideated a dragonfly-inspired wing mechanism. With soft robotics, I also learnt about biomimicry and replicating their mechanisms. I am confident that biomechanics and soft robotics are the fields I want to contribute to.

With my experience as a DAAD WISE intern, I identified a key problem I want to solve. The rise of Industry 4.0 has prompted a key goal: developing machines that can interact safely with humans in diverse and unpredictable environments. Humanoids have been developed for this problem, and much research has been done on their controls and vision. While their brains have been optimised, their bodies are still primitive, with rigid materials and electric motors. To make these robots human-interactive, there is a need to make robot bodies inspired by the soft materials designed in nature. This is the key idea of soft robotics, and applying this idea in the form of soft actuators that could replicate biological muscles motivates my research in this field. Having traversed a journey from being fascinated by robotics to mimicking nature, I have come a long way and want to continue.

This work was part of my internship at the Robotics Materials Department of Max Planck Institute of Intelligent Systems, Stuttgart, under the supervision of Prof. Christoph Keplinger and Mr. Toshihiko Fukushima, which I did through the DAAD WISE Scholarship. My activities encompassed three main topics: 1. fabrication of the soft electrohydraulic actuators, 2. analytical study of the electrical-mechanical interfacing of the actuator, and 3. development of a robotic application of the actuator. I implemented a semi-mass-production scale fabrication process for the first topic, producing over fifty actuators using CNC machining, screen printing, laser cutting, and silicone coating. For the second topic, I formulated the relationship between the electrical and mechanical behaviour of the actuator using the Lagrangian equation of motion, partially uncovering correlations between these parameters. For the third topic, I developed a bio-inspired active hinge structure. He initiatively presented the idea of the structure and started this project. He prototyped the joint by surveying biological literature and utilizing bio-mimetic design, CAD design, and 3D printing. The joint successfully worked with high-speed reciprocating motion (20Hz), and I demonstrated it to other intern students. I presented these results in a department meeting, gaining experience in structuring academic presentations. Additionally, as an observer, I attended the EuroEAP 2024 academic conference and engaged in discussions with various presenters. I also participated in Robotics Institute Germany Interns (RIGI), actively networking with other international interns.

Underwater soft robotics is an emerging field due to the increased need for underwater exploration and surveillance, which requires blending with natural habitats. Although previous work has been done mimicking fishes and octopuses, only a few have tried to imitate the mantle movement of squid. Mimicking the mantle's propulsion mechanism could lead to a compact design, which we have presented through the TorsioSquid, a bio-inspired robotic system. Its unique propulsion is achieved through a synergy of torsional buckling [1] and Bowden cables arranged in a helical pattern around a semi-ellipsoidal Ecoflex shell. At its heart, a linear actuator drives the system by pulling on the cables, inducing controlled buckling and mimicking the squid's mantle movement to generate thrust. In previous similar works, rigid components like motors and gears have been used to mimic squids [2]. These components often fail under cyclic loads. Our design of TorsioSquid prioritizes using softer components like bowden cables and torsional buckling to mimic squids. We have simulation results specifically and have estimated the mass of TorsioSquid to be 800 g and length of 540 mm through its CAD model. Using Ansys, we concluded that TorsioSquid achieves a notable mass ejection rate of 0.4 kg/sec, contributing to significant thrust force.

I have also presented a [Research Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/120D_fVipqrh5kn02wX2aB7rf0W7uzAVA/view?usp=sharing) on this project at the CyPhySS 2024 conference, IISc and it also got selected in IEEE RoboSoft 2024.

Working on optimisation of the design parameters of a soft pneumatic actuator using finite element methods. The goal was to achieve maximum bending at specific pressures while minimising stress concentrations. Additionally, I explored alternative designs to enhance efficiency within soft robotics. I have used Yeoh 3rd Order Model for hyperelastic material assessment and the Multizone method for meshing due to its better computational efficiency than other meshing methods. The 1st image shows the optimized design for better bending by changing the lower layer's thickness and the chambers' height. The second image shows the alternative designs of Soft Pneumatic Acuators: a Tetrahedral chamber pneumatic actuator, a Tail-based pneumatic actuator and a Claw-based pneumatic actuator.

I have also presented a [Research Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKaG4lekKximDFqkhfywGVruPG-K98S-/view?usp=sharing) on this project at Engineer Conclave, Inter IIT Tech Meet 2023.

Worked on an ideation competition named Biognosis on biomimicry by Shaastra, IIT Madras, where I presented my idea of soft robotic fish. I came under the top 10 individuals nationwide in this. In this, I worked on biomimicry to develop a unique solution whose target application will be SDG goal 14 - Life Below Water. My idea is based on how aquatic organisms tackle this issue of water pollution. I took inspiration from aquatic organisms like Coral reefs and Tilapia fish. I studied smart materials like Shape Memory Alloys and dielectric elastomers and integrated them to design flow within soft robotic fish.

This was an exploratory team project under [Dr. Pawan Sharma](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mec/people/pawanmec), Mechanical Dept, IIT BHU, in which I, along with my team, tried to optimize drone arm structure using the SIMP algorithm of SOLIDWORKS and using naturally topology-optimized structures like gyroids. We evaluate their strength using Ansys Mechanical by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Ultimately, we concluded that the drone arm structure made using the SIMP algorithm was most efficient regarding the safety-to-weight ratio factor. Also, we concluded that the strength of the gyroid drone arm will depend on the gyoid's thickness, and increasing it will increase its safety factor and mass.

This project was part of my research internship at Stoch Lab, RBCCPS, IISc under [Professor Shishir N. Y. Kolathaya](http://www.shishirny.com/). I analyzed the shank using Ansys Structural and reduced its weight by 16% using TPMS structures like the gyroid. Mass reduction is an excellent way to have reasonable control in robotics as it also reduces the inertia of legs. I tried to reduce mass by using biomimicry, inserting some nature-inspired structures in the shank's central portion, and covering it with thick plates. Butterfly wings have inspired this design with beams enclosing gyroids. I also 3D printed a sample of the gyroid to get a physical feel of it.

This project is a part of the EnCode competition, an automobile competition by IIT Guwahati and Bosch. Under the SAE collegiate club, IIT BHU, I participated in the EV segment as a Team Trinity member. We proposed our design of a tadpole EV with a skateboard chassis consisting of in-wheel motors. We created an eDrive for this EV and learnt about the powertrain and transmission in an EV. We verified our calculations through the MATLAB model of our EV. In a team of 4, I contributed to this project by doing CAD modelling of the skateboard chassis and its structural analysis using Ansys. I also contributed to the design of eDrive. We won first place in the EV segment of EnCode. For more details - [EV Design Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xmvkoqvSBzPk9cg7nzvwNpH14vDJZ9jZ/view?usp=sharing).

This project is under  Team Trident, SAE Collegiate Club, IIT(BHU), Varanasi, for the SUPRA SAE competition. This is based on the designing, simulation, and manufacturing of chassis. We did chassis design in SOLIDWORKS and simulated in Ansys Mechanical using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to get stress-strain properties of the chassis. We did front impact testing, side impact testing, and rear impact testing and did hand-in calculations to verify Ansys results. After finalizing the chassis' design and getting suitable results from the simulation, we proceed to its manufacturing. We used AISI 1018 steel pipes and Manual Arc Welding to weld them.
