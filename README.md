## About Me

I am Naman Khetan

ðŸ”§ Mechanical Engineer | ðŸ’¡ Problem Solver | ðŸš€ Innovator

I am a 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering student pursuing BTech in IIT BHU. I hailed from Raebareli, Uttar Pradesh. My research interests lie in soft robotics, smart materials, mechatronics, design optimization, and legged robotics. 

## My journey

I am quite passionate about core mechanical engineering. Exploring this diverse field, I got interested in materials, design optimization, and robotics. Learning CAD using SOLIDWORKS and FEA simulation using Ansys. Coming into my 2nd year, I got interested in smart materials and their applications. That's when I got into soft robotics. I found applications of smart materials like shape memory alloys, piezoelectric materials, and dielectric elastomers in robotics, which fascinate me. 

I learned more about robotics design and how to connect it with controls during my research internship at Stoch Lab, RBCCPS, IISc. I worked on the design optimization of a quadrupled-legged robot having a 20 Kg payload capacity for military purposes.
