### Hi there üëã

## About Me

I am Naman Khetan

üîß Mechanical Engineer | üí° Problem Solver | üöÄ Innovator

I am a 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering student pursuing BTech in IIT BHU. I hailed from Raebareli, Uttar Pradesh. My research interests lie in soft robotics, smart materials, mechatronics, design optimization, and legged robotics. 

## My journey

I am quite passionate about core mechanical engineering. Exploring this diverse field, I got interested in materials, design optimization, and robotics. Learning CAD using SOLIDWORKS and FEA simulation using Ansys. Coming into my 2nd year, I got interested in smart materials and their applications. That's when I got into soft robotics. I found applications of smart materials like shape memory alloys, piezoelectric materials, and dielectric elastomers in robotics, which fascinate me. 

I learned more about robotics design and how to connect it with controls during my research internship at Stoch Lab, RBCCPS, IISc. I worked on the design optimization of a quadrupled-legged robot having a 20 Kg payload capacity for military purposes.

Working on optimisation of the design parameters of a soft pneumatic actuator using finite element methods. The goal was to achieve maximum bending at specific pressures while minimising stress concentrations. Additionally, I explored alternative designs to enhance efficiency within soft robotics. I have used Yeoh 3rd Order Model for hyperelastic material assessment and the Multizone method for meshing due to its better computational efficiency than other meshing methods. The 1st image shows the optimized design for better bending by changing the lower layer's thickness and the chambers' height. The second image shows the alternative designs of Soft Pneumatic Acuators in the form of tetrahedral chambered actuators, the varied thickness of chambers and claw-type soft actuators.  For more details, see [Design Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18GiEdoUFC8UQ9kivAJjQR3PTv4II8ksH/view?usp=sharing). I have also presented a [Research Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKaG4lekKximDFqkhfywGVruPG-K98S-/view?usp=sharing) on this project at Engineer Conclave, Inter IIT Tech Meet 2023.

Worked on an ideation competition named Biognosis on biomimicry by Shaastra, IIT Madras, where I presented my idea of soft robotic fish. I came under the top 10 individuals nationwide in this. In this, I worked on biomimicry to develop a unique solution whose target application will be SDG goal 14 - Life Below Water. My idea is based on how aquatic organisms tackle this issue of water pollution. I took inspiration from aquatic organisms like Coral reefs and Tilapia fish. I studied smart materials like Shape Memory Alloys and dielectric elastomers and integrated them to design flow within soft robotic fish.

This was an exploratory team project under [Dr. Pawan Sharma](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mec/people/pawanmec), Mechanical Dept, IIT BHU, in which I, along with my team, tried to optimize drone arm structure using the SIMP algorithm of SOLIDWORKS and using naturally topology-optimized structures like gyroids. We evaluate their strength using Ansys Mechanical by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Ultimately, we concluded that the drone arm structure made using the SIMP algorithm was most efficient regarding the safety-to-weight ratio factor. Also, we concluded that the strength of the gyroid drone arm will depend on the gyoid's thickness, and increasing it will increase its safety factor and mass.

This project was part of my research internship at Stoch Lab, RBCCPS, IISc under [Professor Shishir N. Y. Kolathaya](http://www.shishirny.com/). I analyzed the shank using Ansys Structural and reduced its weight by 16% using TPMS structures like the gyroid. Mass reduction is an excellent way to have reasonable control in robotics as it also reduces the inertia of legs. I tried to reduce mass by using biomimicry, inserting some nature-inspired structures in the shank's central portion, and covering it with thick plates. Butterfly wings have inspired this design with beams enclosing gyroids. I also 3D printed a sample of the gyroid to get a physical feel of it.

This project is a part of the EnCode competition, an automobile competition by IIT Guwahati and Bosch. Under the SAE collegiate club, IIT BHU, I participated in the EV segment as a Team Trinity member. We proposed our design of a tadpole EV with a skateboard chassis consisting of in-wheel motors. We created an eDrive for this EV and learnt about the powertrain and transmission in an EV. We verified our calculations through the MATLAB model of our EV. In a team of 4, I contributed to this project by doing CAD modeling of the skateboard chassis and its structural analysis using Ansys. I also contributed to the design of eDrive. We won first place in the EV segment of EnCode. For more details - [EV Design Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xmvkoqvSBzPk9cg7nzvwNpH14vDJZ9jZ/view?usp=sharing).

This project is under  Team Trident, SAE Collegiate Club, IIT(BHU), Varanasi, for the SUPRA SAE competition. This is based on the designing, simulation, and manufacturing of chassis. We did chassis design in SOLIDWORKS and simulated in Ansys Mechanical using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to get stress-strain properties of the chassis. We did front impact testing, side impact testing, and rear impact testing and did hand-in calculations to verify Ansys results. After finalizing the chassis' design and getting suitable results from the simulation, we proceed to its manufacturing. We used AISI 1018 steel pipes and Manual Arc Welding to weld them.
